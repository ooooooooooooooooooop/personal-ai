"""Wiring tests for CDPTransport (Phase 5 PR2 extraction).

These verify the extraction moved the 7 wire-primitive methods onto
CDPTransport and that the transport reaches the driver's socket + id table
through the correct seam. They are NOT behavioral tests — the behavior of
each method is already covered exhaustively by test_cdp_foundation
(concurrent _cdp, pending cleanup, reader-on-socket-close) and the broad
suite, which stub the driver's transport methods and confirm the delegators
preserve the surface. This file guards the wiring: no method is dropped, the
transport talks to the driver (not to itself) for socket/id-table state, and
the driver wires the transport in __init__.

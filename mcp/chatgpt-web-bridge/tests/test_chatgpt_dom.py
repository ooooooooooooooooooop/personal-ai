"""Wiring tests for ChatGPTDom (Phase 5 PR3 extraction).

These verify the extraction moved the 9 composer-DOM methods + 4 selector
constants onto ChatGPTDom and that the DOM layer reaches the driver's
transport/breaker/navigation through the correct seam. They are NOT
behavioral tests — the behavior of each method is already covered by
test_composer_selectors / test_conversation_guard / test_resilience and the
broad suite, which stub the driver's DOM methods and confirm the delegators
preserve the surface. This file guards the wiring: no method is dropped, the
DOM layer talks to the driver (not to itself) for transport/breaker, state
stays on the driver, selectors stay importable from cdp_driver, and the
driver wires _dom in __init__.

# Changelog

All notable changes to KAOS are documented here.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-09-02

- **`kaos memory write <name> …` no longer crashes with a foreign-key error** when the
  first argument is not an existing agent id. It now accepts an agent *name* and creates a
  lightweight agent on first use — which is exactly what the plugin's `/kaos:recall` skill
  tells users to run (`kaos memory write claude-code "<lesson>"`). Found by the 2.1.0
  end-to-end validation: a real Claude Code session with the plugin quoted the injected
  team lesson verbatim, but the seed step written the way the skill describes had failed.
- Marketplace manifest gains a description (`claude plugin validate` warning).
- `kaos experiment list` ordering is deterministic when runs share a millisecond
  (`exp_id` tiebreak) — this was the recurring CI test flake; it failed the first
  2.1.1 release run.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-02

**KAOS attaches to the tools you already run — and publishes its numbers, including the
ones it failed.** Everything here is M1–M6 of `docs/roadmap/v2.1-stars.md`, a roadmap
produced by running KAOS on its own growth question.

- **Claude Code plugin** — `claude plugin marketplace add canivel/kaos` then
  `/plugin install kaos@kaos`. Every session becomes an auditable agent
  (`claude-code:<session>`) in `kaos.db`: SessionStart injects weighted-ranked team
  memory, PostToolUse/Stop/SessionEnd journal every tool call and turn (async), the
  58-tool MCP server auto-registers, `/kaos:recall` searches memory. No-marketplace
  path: `kaos connect claude-code` (writes `.claude/settings.json` + `.mcp.json`, idempotent).
- **`kaos-hook`** — new dependency-light entrypoint the hooks call; never blocks a session.
  **Pre-registered latency probe (`benchmarks/cc_hook_latency`) verdict: `REJECT:prompt`** —
  session-start p95 241 ms passed its 400 ms gate, prompt-time recall p95 275 ms failed
  its 200 ms gate, so the `UserPromptSubmit` hook journals only and injects memory off by
  default (`kaos connect claude-code --prompt-inject` to enable). The v1 probe's
  instrument defect is kept on record.
- **`kaos journal append`** — record external sessions' events (what the Pi extension and
  the hooks use). **`kaos memory search --format inject --token-cap N`** — compact context
  block; raw FTS5 syntax errors (hyphens, colons) now fall back to a sanitized query
  instead of crashing.
- **`kaos demo --print`** — the terminal aha: seeds 50,000 memories in a temp file, runs a
  real search and prints the measured p95 (never a quoted number), shows the audit table,
  exits in ~2 s, writes nothing to your directory. It is now the README's first screen.
- **ulid-py removed** — `import ulid` cost 216 ms per CLI start; `kaos/_ids.py` generates
  format-identical ULIDs. Base install is 4 dependencies.
- **Benchmarks, all hash-locked before running, results committed as they came:**
  - `benchmarks/prg` (Paraphrase Recall Gap, owns issue #42): instrument ACCEPT; paraphrase
    miss rate **100 %** with the CLI default query, 86 % with OR-joined terms.
  - `benchmarks/longmemeval` (split-reported, S set, 500 questions): verbatim R@5 **0.991**,
    paraphrase **0.965**, aggregate 0.976 at 0.9 ms p95 — with the README explaining why a
    BM25-class retriever is expected to be strong at S scale and what this does *not* claim.
  - `benchmarks/afb` (Agent Forensics Bench v1): checkpoint fidelity 100 %, journal
    completeness 100 %, isolation 0 leaks, replay deterministic, recovery overhead 8 % —
    and **REJECT on fault localization** (median 9.5 entries vs ≤ 5): the critical-step
    localizer's "earliest write before the first error" heuristic points at session
    set-up. Published as found; a fix must pass the same lock.
- **`kaos-eval` GitHub Action** (`action.yml`, Marketplace-ready) + `.github/workflows/kaos-eval.yml`
  run the benchmarks on every release and fail on REJECT/VOID — so the next release
  fails until the localizer is fixed. That is the discipline working.
- **`integrations/pi-kaos`** — Pi extension (TypeScript, shells to the same CLI verbs);
  `contrib/plugin-template` + `CONTRIBUTING.md` + five queued good-first-issues.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-09-01

**`agent_sdk` provider actually works now — tool-calling + session isolation (red-first).**
Found by the launch user-journey: any tool-using task through `provider: agent_sdk` died
with "Reached maximum number of turns (1)". Two root causes, both fixed:

- **The SDK session inherited the user's Claude Code config** — their personal MCP servers
  (mail, travel, ...) leaked into KAOS agents, and built-in tools (Write/Bash) tempted the
  model into a tool round-trip its single turn couldn't complete. The session is now fully
  isolated: `mcp_servers={}`, `strict_mcp_config=True`, `tools=[]`, `allowed_tools=[]`.
- **OpenAI-style tools were dropped** (text-only degradation). The provider now speaks the
  same `<tool_call>` prompt protocol as `claude_code` — `serialize_conversation` /
  `parse_tool_response` extracted as shared helpers in `kaos.router.providers` — so the
  CCR runner executes tools against the VFS exactly as with every other provider. An
  `is_error` result with streamed text degrades gracefully instead of raising.

Validated end-to-end: real `kaos run` tasks through the SDK complete multi-tool sessions
(fs_mkdir / fs_write / shell_exec / fs_ls) with every call journaled. New `[agent-sdk]`
extra declares the `claude-agent-sdk` dependency (included in `[all]`). 948 tests
passing (+6).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-09-01

Packaging patch. 2.0.0 shipped wheel-only: the default hatchling sdist packed demo
GIFs/papers/benches into 141 MB, over PyPI's 100 MB file cap, and PyPI's immutable
filenames plus wheel build non-determinism made completing 2.0.0 impossible. The sdist is
now 437 KB (package + tests + metadata only), `uv publish --check-url` makes reruns
idempotent, and the CI failure reporter scrubs tokens before posting. No code changes.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-01 — Distribution & modularity (adoption roadmap P0+P1)

KAOS 2.0 is about being installable, adoptable, and extensible — the follow-through on
`docs/roadmap/v0.11-adoption.md` (the Pi-gap analysis). No new mechanisms; the discipline
holds. **931 tests passing (+16), 1 skipped.**

- **PyPI distribution `kaos-harness`** (the bare `kaos` name has been squatted since 2016;
  the import stays `kaos`, the CLI stays `kaos`). `pip install 'kaos-harness[all]'` +
  `kaos demo` is the new two-command, zero-key first run.
- **Slim base + extras (G1.1/G1.2).** Base install carries 5 deps (click, ulid-py,
  zstandard, pyyaml, rich) — flight recorder, brain, web dashboard, CLI. `[router]`
  (httpx providers), `[mcp]` (58-tool server), `[ui]` (textual TUI), `[eval]` (named,
  dep-free today), `[all]`. Optional imports route through `kaos._extras.require`; a
  missing extra prints the exact install line instead of a traceback (console entry point
  is now `kaos.cli.main:main`, which catches `MissingExtraError`). A layering test pins
  that importing the base surface never pulls httpx/mcp/textual.
- **Plugin surface `kaos.plugins` (G1.3).** Entry-point group `kaos.plugins`; a plugin's
  `register(registry)` can add model providers (reachable through `create_provider`),
  meta-harness benchmarks (`get_benchmark`), MCP tool packs (listed + dispatched by the
  server), and reserved fleet-adapter/dream-phase hooks. Broken plugins are reported and
  skipped, never fatal. New `kaos plugins` command. Tested end-to-end with a toy
  distribution discovered purely via entry points.
- **Repo hygiene (G0.2 — partial: 40+ visible root entries → 18 tracked; the ≤ 15 gate
  is missed by 3 because `blog/` and `index.html` are pinned by published GitHub Pages
  URLs; recorded, not redefined).** The 20 `demo_*` bench suites moved to `benchmarks/`
  (history preserved via git renames); loose root images moved to `docs/assets/`;
  `paper/`, `paper2/`, `video_scripts/` moved under `docs/`; `seed_engagement.py` to
  `examples/`; the user-local `kaos.yaml` untracked (the `.example` stays). Bench modules
  keep their historical top-level import names — root `conftest.py` and
  `kaos.plugins.ensure_probe_paths()` put `benchmarks/` on `sys.path`, so hash-locked
  probe adapters, `--probe demo_x...:Cls` specs, and the experiments journal stay valid.
  Probe loading no longer depends on CWD being importable.
- **README inversion (G0.3).** Install + runnable commands + dashboard GIF in the first
  screen; the discipline story follows the product. Extras table documents the tiered
  install; jargon gets a plain-English alias on first use.
- **`consolidate --apply` after a dry-run actually applies (P0 fix, red-first).** The
  v0.10 re-proposal dedup treated *pending* journal rows as blocking, so the documented
  dry-run → apply workflow (and any apply after the automatic threshold cycle) applied
  nothing. Dedup now blocks only DECIDED identities (applied/rejected); pending rows are
  what `--apply` acts on — flipped by proposal_id, never re-inserted. Second latent fix in
  the same path: `_mark_applied` matched by targets blob, which the promote path mutates
  (`new_skill_id`) before marking — promotes were applied but journaled pending forever.
  Found by the ARC-AGI-3 validation scenario (70/76 → 75/75, which also had a stale
  schema-version assertion now pinned to `kaos.schema.SCHEMA_VERSION`). 4 new tests.
- **Dependency truth from clean-install testing.** The web dashboard imported
  `starlette`/`uvicorn` that no dependency declared — it worked only via `mcp`'s
  transitive deps; both are now declared under `[ui]` with a `require()` boundary. And
  `mcp>=1.0` resolved to mcp 2.x on fresh installs, whose Server API drops the
  `list_tools()`/`call_tool()` decorators this server uses — now pinned `>=1.0,<2`.
- **Release automation (G0.4).** Tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow builds and
  publishes to PyPI (trusted publishing) and creates the GitHub Release.

Versioning note: 2.0.0 (not 0.11) marks the packaging break — the distribution rename and
the extras split change every install line. Library APIs, the schema (v9), and the CLI
surface are unchanged aside from the new `kaos plugins` command.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-08 — Tier-1 (measure & harden)

Follow-through on the v0.10 scoping panel (`docs/roadmap/v0.10-candidates.md`): deterministic hardening, no capability claims. The wave also absorbed defect fixes and infrastructure distilled from five paper evaluations run under the falsifiable-eval discipline (SAGE-class through Sara/lenz; three full probes — VOID#1, GDL do-not-ship, PFA REJECT — none shipped on hope). **764 tests passing, 1 skipped.**

- **`kaos eval verify-numerics` — numbers in generated artifacts must trace to recorded measurements.** Unparks AutoResearchClaw's verifiable-numeric-reporting idea now that the experiments journal exists to trace against. Extracts measurement-shaped numbers (decimals, %/pp, latency/throughput units, fractions, large counts) from any text artifact and classifies each against the journal + given `results.json`: verified / unverifiable / allowlisted (semver, dates, years, file:line, URLs, hashes, #-ordinals). Pure regex + exact-value lookup with typographic-unicode folding — offline, deterministic, no embeddings/LLM. Precision-first: a fabrication must never read "verified". Acceptance gates pre-registered in `demo_verify_numerics_bench/ACCEPTANCE.md` before the logic; 31 tests; dogfooded on a real probe verdict (29 verified / 7 unverifiable, zero false-verified).
- **mh_search defect fixes + PSI stats (from the Sara/lenz eval, arXiv:2608.00316).** (1) `_update_stagnation` ignored objective *direction* — it recorded the worst cost as "best" for minimize objectives and read any movement, including a `-context_cost` regression, as improvement, starving the CORAL pivot; now direction-aware, reproduced red-first. (2) Removed the dead proposer archive-tool apparatus (the single-shot path always ran `tools=[]`) and the prompt contradiction that advertised those tools then disabled them. (3) mh_search now writes to the experiments journal (`family=mh_search`) — the schema promised it and never delivered. (4) Proposer rationale is captured for real instead of a constant placeholder. New read-only `kaos mh stats <id>` computes candidate-vs-incumbent bootstrap CIs over organic per-problem labels, flagging within-noise "improvements".
- **#7 plasticity-loop-closure remainder.** Consolidation re-proposal dedup: a human-rejected merge pair (both skills stay active) or an applied promote used to reappear every cycle; proposals now carry a canonical order-independent identity and any identity already on the journal is skipped. skill_apply / skill_outcome now thread `agent_id` into `record_outcome`, so `skill_uses` telemetry and the per-agent Hebbian association stop being written with NULL attribution.
- **`storage-scale-bench` — single-DB does NOT saturate; per-agent-DB sharding REJECT-by-measurement.** Built `demo_storage_scale_bench/`; at 10k agents cross-agent FTS5 `memory_search` p95 is 9.2 ms (~55× under the sanity line). The real cost is write-commit contention, flat with scale. See the bench README.
- **Default `synchronous` flipped `FULL` → `NORMAL` (behavior change).** The bench measured NORMAL ~125× faster on write p95 (1895 ms → 15 ms) and ~38× higher throughput (29 → 1118 ops/s) under 8-thread contention, zero lock errors. NORMAL is SQLite's recommended WAL setting; the only trade is that an OS crash / power loss (not an application crash) may lose the last few committed transactions — the database stays consistent and uncorrupted. `synchronous`/`wal_autocheckpoint` are now constructor args on `Kaos(...)`; pass `synchronous="FULL"` for the strictest durability. (Test suite also ~2× faster as a side effect.)
- **Trust sweep: tool-count single source of truth + first CLI tests.** The MCP tool count was stated as 17/18/25/45/50/58 across six files simultaneously; `kaos setup` printed a hardcoded wrong number at install time. Now `build_tool_list()` / `mcp_tool_count()` are authoritative, all current-state docs say 58, and doc-consistency + dispatch-coverage tests (every registered tool has a dispatch branch and vice versa) prevent re-drift. First smoke tests for the previously untested `cli/main.py`.
- **Plasticity loops closed for the MCP surface.** `agent_memory_search` now records `memory_hits` (default on) and threads `requesting_agent_id` — previously the neuroplasticity layer received zero signal from MCP-driven agents. Deprecated skills are now excluded from `SkillStore.search()`/`list()` by default (`include_deprecated` escape hatch); prune/merge was cosmetic before.
- **Router/provider reliability sweep.** `ProposerStalled`/`TimeoutError` now pass through `GEPARouter._call_model` untouched — the blanket RuntimeError rewrap had silently defeated the v0.9 P0 #11 fix for router-routed calls. Fallback model is actually reachable (was dead config at the default `max_retries=1`); auth errors fail fast instead of burning retries; `ModelConfig.timeout` is forwarded to openai/anthropic/local clients (was silently dropped); every call runs under an absolute wall (`cfg.timeout + wall_margin`) because httpx read timeouts are between-bytes; malformed model-emitted tool args become `{"raw": ...}` instead of crashing routing; `agent_sdk` warns when OpenAI-style tools are dropped. Bonus: two present-but-empty kwarg bugs in `create_provider` — an openai model without an explicit endpoint always crashed at construction, and an empty `api_key_env` never fell back to the default env var.
- **Verdict statistical rigor.** New `cluster_bootstrap_diff_ci` resamples runs (not queries) so gate intervals reflect run-to-run variance — single-run pass@1 varies 2.2–6.0pp even at temp 0, inside a +4pp gate's margin. New `check_power_budget` makes a lock-declared `statistics.runs_per_condition` binding: fewer runs than pre-registered VOIDs the verdict. Existing locks (no statistics block) remain valid single-run probes; neither prior binding verdict changes retroactively.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-24

### Tier-0 correctness debt — fix the instrument before building anything new

A 48-agent scoping panel (see `docs/roadmap/v0.10-candidates.md`) reviewed every subsystem and turned up reproduced P0 bugs — including two in the v0.9 eval harness itself. The framework's pitch is verified reliability; shipping new mechanisms on top of a VFS that crashes on delete-then-rewrite and an eval harness whose judge cannot fail would be theater. v0.9.2 fixes the P0s, red-first (each test fails on pre-fix HEAD, passes after). No new features. **650 tests passing (+27), 1 skipped.**

**Core storage correctness + concurrency** (`kaos/core.py`, `blobs.py`, `events.py`, `checkpoints.py`, `shared_log.py`, `memory.py`):
- **write() version collision** — next version was `MAX(version)` over `deleted=0` rows only, against `UNIQUE(agent_id,path,version)` which spans tombstones; delete-then-rewrite and restore-then-write reset the counter to 1 and crashed with `IntegrityError`, defeating checkpoint/time-travel. Now computes over all rows and is wrapped in a transaction with rollback.
- **read() held an open write transaction** — the FILE_READ audit event is an INSERT that implicitly begins a write txn; leaving it open pinned the single WAL writer lock and blocked every other connection's writes. Now commits immediately after logging.
- **Helpers pinned the init-thread connection** — BlobStore/EventJournal/CheckpointManager captured the connection at construction, splitting a cross-thread `write()` across two connections. They now resolve the calling thread's connection via a getter.
- **query() read-only bypass** — the keyword-prefix blacklist passed `REPLACE`/`WITH..DELETE`/`PRAGMA`/`ATTACH`/`VACUUM` on the full-privilege connection, and query() is agent-reachable via MCP `agent_query`. Now enforced at the SQLite parse layer via an authorizer callback; an 11-payload adversarial suite all raise `PermissionError`.
- **SharedLog position race** — read-then-insert let concurrent appenders collide on `UNIQUE(position)`; now a single atomic `INSERT..SELECT`.

**Eval-harness integrity** (`kaos/eval/harness/`) — the verdict instrument was unsound:
- **Empty kill-gate list computed ACCEPT** (`all([])` is True) — a probe that gated nothing auto-passed. Now VOID.
- **Blind-judge kappa was a tautology** — `jq.correct == jq.correct`, always 1.0, so the kappa VOID gate was dead code. Now a real agreement statistic over an optional independent second label, or explicitly `None` (kappa-exempt) for mechanical-ground-truth probes — never a silent 1.0.
- **Probe.verify() crashed** on the results.json shapes `run()` actually produces (KeyError on missing per_query; KeyError on the empty-arms VOID file). Now short-circuits VOID runs, reconstructs from persisted per_query, and raises a clear error on legacy files.

**Meta-harness CORAL pivot was dead code** (`kaos/metaharness/search.py`, `proposer.py`) — the Tier-1 stagnation pivot (a v0.6 headline feature) could never fire: `_update_stagnation` stamped `pivot_fired_at` the moment stagnation hit the threshold, and the proposer's identical predicate then computed `stagnant - pivot_fired_at = 0 < threshold`. Now a single authority raises a `pivot_pending` flag that the proposer consumes; regression-tested that the pivot prompt is actually assembled.

**Also:** `kaos --version` reported a hardcoded `0.7.0` (three majors stale); now reads `kaos.__version__`, guarded by a consistency test. `MemoryStore.get_by_key` tie-breaks by `memory_id` (a same-millisecond flake).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-26

### MCP exposure of v0.9 surfaces — 50 → 58 tools

Patch release. v0.9.0 deliberately held the MCP surface flat while the doctor / eval / experiment CLI groups stabilized. Two days of real use confirmed the read-side of the experiment journal is a legitimate mid-conversation need (agents asking "what mechanisms have we already evaluated?") and the eval probe + doctor surfaces compose cleanly into agent-driven research workflows. v0.9.1 exposes all eight new commands through MCP so Claude Code and other MCP clients can call them directly.

**New MCP tools (8):**

| Tool | Category | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `doctor_proposer` | Provider smoke | parallel ok/stalled/wall-timeout/error check; catches the P0 #11 failure mode before a meta-harness search burns minutes |
| `eval_probe_falsify` | Eval | gate-first self-test (FULL := B0 must REJECT or the harness is INADMISSIBLE) |
| `eval_probe_run` | Eval | execute a probe end-to-end; long-running; returns binding verdict + writes results.json |
| `eval_probe_verify` | Eval | re-compute verdict from a saved results.json against gate code at HEAD; read-only, fast |
| `experiment_log` | Experiment journal | insert one row with auto-filled git_sha |
| `experiment_list` | Experiment journal | newest-first listing with name / family / verdict-prefix filters |
| `experiment_show` | Experiment journal | dump one row by exp_id |
| `experiment_compare` | Experiment journal | diff two rows by field; "what changed since the last run?" |

Each tool surfaces errors as `Error: <type>: <msg>` JSON strings rather than crashing the dispatcher — the rule the existing MCP layer already follows.

**Test coverage (20 new, full path):** `tests/test_mcp_v091.py` covers list_tools surface (count, required-field declarations, schema sanity), end-to-end dispatch for all 8 tools via `call_tool`, error containment for unknown tools / missing args / malformed probe specs, real round-trip log → list → show → compare against the real `ExperimentStore`, and real falsification self-test against the action-realization probe adapter. Each test exercises the FULL MCP path (list_tools + call_tool), not the underlying primitives alone — catches schema mismatches, dispatch wiring bugs, JSON serialization issues.

**Wiring fix:** removed the top-level `assert _ccr is not None` from `_dispatch`. _ccr is only needed by agent_spawn / agent_parallel / mh_* tools; the v0.9.1 surfaces don't touch it. Per-branch assertions now live with the tools that actually need _ccr.

Full suite: 613 passing + 1 expected skip (verify-with-populated-arms needs organic incident data; skips when local DB has none).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-24

### Reliability, queryability, and a falsifiable-eval primitive

v0.9 is deliberately small. v0.8.3 over-delivered (quality score + failure taxonomy + critical-step localizer + ISA/ISC + war-room UI in one cycle); the repo had spent its mechanism-debt budget. Meanwhile a real P0 user-facing bug (#11) was unfixed and AI-reported #8 (experiment tracking) was open. Five mechanism candidates had been REJECTED or PARKED in research arc earlier in the cycle (SAGE, synthesis-as-consolidation, AutoResearchClaw, HASP, Life-Harness mechanism). Shipping mechanism #N+1 on top of an unfixed P0 would have been theater.

v0.9 productizes the discipline that produced those rejections, fixes the P0, makes experiments queryable, and ships one pre-registered probe whose verdict is reported honestly. **One additive schema migration (v8 → v9), no breaking changes, no new mechanism shipped.**

**PR-1 — `proposer-streaming` (fixes P0 #11)**
- `ClaudeCodeProvider` now uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` with incremental `proc.stdout.read(8192)` gated by `asyncio.wait_for(read_to)` where `read_to = min(idle_timeout, remaining_wall)`
- New `ProposerStalled` exception — distinct from `TimeoutError`; the meta-harness search loop catches it and continues to the next iteration instead of dying
- New CLI: `kaos doctor proposer` smoke-tests every configured provider in parallel and reports `ok / stalled / wall-timeout / error / no-client` with latency

**PR-2 — `kaos.eval.harness` (codify the falsifiable apparatus)**
- New module `kaos/eval/harness/` with reusable primitives: `ArmResults`, `QueryResult`, `GateOutcome`, `bootstrap_diff_ci` (seeded, one inferential statistic for the whole harness), `load_lock` + `LockTamperError` (hash-locked pre-registration that refuses to run on edited locks), `judge_arm` via `SurrogateVerifier` heuristic (anonymised + shuffled stream — arm leakage impossible by construction), `compute_verdict` (uniform ACCEPT/REJECT/VOID rule), and the `Probe` ABC
- New CLI: `kaos eval probe {run, verify, falsify} --probe pkg.mod:ClassName`
- KAOS becomes the first agent framework that ships its own kill-switch primitive

**PR-3 — `experiments` journal (closes #8)**
- Schema v8 → v9: one additive table (`experiments`) recording every probe / mh_search / benchmark run alongside `git_sha`, `lock_sha256`, per-arm aggregates, gate list, verdict — answers "what changed since the last run?" without grep
- New `ExperimentStore` with `log_run() / get() / list() / compare()` and `git_sha` auto-fill from `git rev-parse HEAD`
- New CLI: `kaos experiment {log, list, show, compare}`
- No new MCP tools — surface stays at 50

**PR-4 — `action-realization-probe` (Life-Harness narrow slice, PROBE ONLY)**
- Pre-registered probe at `demo_action_realization_bench/ISA.lock.json` (sha256 `3ca89983...`, committed BEFORE any probe code)
- Kill gates G1-G4 byte-frozen at lock time: FULL beats v0.8.3-native by ≥+4.0pp on action-class slice (G1), causal isolation via L1/L2 lesions ≥+3.0/+2.0pp (G2), no regression on non-action control ≤−1.0pp (G3), inline p95 overhead <500µs (G4)
- Workload: ORGANIC ONLY — `synthetic_fallback: NONE` in lock
- Falsification self-test ADMISSIBLE: `FULL := B1` emits `[KILL: G1]` as required
- **Binding verdict: `VOID#1 (insufficient organic sample)`** — n_action=2 < 200 in the development DB. Per the lock and the spec's §Risks paragraph, this is the correct outcome with no retune permitted. The mechanism stays parked alongside Life-Harness's other un-evaluated slices until enough organic action-class incidents accumulate to re-run at the same lock hash
- v0.10 is NOT pre-committed to the mechanism. Six candidates were evaluated this v0.9 cycle, zero mechanisms shipped — the discipline IS the deliverable

**Tests: 593 passing** (up from 557 at v0.8.3 + 36 new: 7 streaming, 20 eval-harness, 9 experiments, 7 action-realization-probe + 2 schema-migration version-pin updates).

**No banned-package use** (no `litellm`, no `openai` SDK; raw httpx + `claude_code` provider + `agent_sdk` only).

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-13

### Finer-grained outcomes, failures, objectives — and a war-room UI

One point release, one additive schema migration (v7 → v8), no breaking changes. Folds four tracks that were originally scoped as separate releases. Full plan: [docs/roadmap/v0.8.3.md](docs/roadmap/v0.8.3.md).

**Track A — continuous quality score [0,1]**
- `SkillStore.record_outcome(quality=...)` — optional partial-credit outcome in `[0,1]`; `ValueError` outside range (never silently clamped)
- `_quality_signal_map()` feeds the plasticity ranker `SUM(quality)` for graded rows, `SUM(success)` for binary, absent when no graded rows so the binary path is byte-for-byte unchanged
- `wilson_lower_bound` typed for float successes with a sourced note on the continuous-Bernoulli generalisation (Brown/Cai/DasGupta 2001)
- CLI `kaos skills outcome <id> [--success|--fail] [--quality Q]`; MCP `skill_outcome` gains `quality`
- **Measured: +4.0pp accuracy (85.3% → 89.3%)** across 5 seeds — `demo_quality_score_bench/`. The variance-reduction hypothesis did *not* hold and the benchmark reports that honestly.

**Track B1 — reasoning-class failure taxonomy** (arXiv:2509.25370)
- `taxonomy_class` (memory/reflection/planning/action/system/unknown) + free-form `taxonomy_subclass`, orthogonal to the execution-flavoured `category`
- 8 heuristics post-stamped; `LLMDiagnoser` emits + caches taxonomy; `classify_taxonomy()` helper
- CLI `kaos dream failures --taxonomy-class planning`

**Track B2 — critical-step localizer**
- `kaos/dream/phases/localize.py` — reconstructs the agent's `tool_calls + shared_log` timeline and points at the *earliest decisive* step, not the visible error
- Heuristic-first; LLM only below the confidence floor, cached by trajectory-shape fingerprint
- CLI `kaos dream localize <agent_id>`; MCP `dream_localize`
- **Measured: 5/5 planted-bug trajectories localized within ±1 step** (gate ≥4/5) — `demo_critical_step_bench/`

**Track B3 — Ideal State Artifacts (ISA/ISC)** (PAI pattern)
- `kaos/ideal_state.py` — declare "what done looks like" as verifiable criteria; per-criterion pass/fail is a finer plasticity signal than one binary task outcome
- CLI `kaos ideal-state create|mark|show|list`; MCP `ideal_state_create|mark|get`
- **Track composition**: `record_skill_outcome()` bridges ISA quality → Track A graded outcome; `failed_criteria_by_taxonomy()` groups by Track B1; `link_critical_step()` ties a failing ISC to Track B2's localized step

**Track C — Aegean incremental quorum: gated out**
- The forward-compat columns `shared_log.vote_confidence` / `decide_mode` ship in the v8 migration, but the decide-side code stays unbuilt per the documented gating rule (no ≥5-concurrent-agent deployments, no latency issue, no request). Honest no-op, not a shortcut.

**Track D — war-room UI refresh** (Naroh091/hermes-war-room IA, MIT)
- **No stack change**: vanilla single static HTML file + the existing Starlette server. No Nuxt/Vue/Bun, no new dependency, no schema change
- New `kaos/ui/static/warroom.html`: split layout (mission control ‖ operatives floor), deterministic colored monogram discs, click-to-dossier slide-over, LogAct intent kanban, light/dark toggle (dark default, persisted)
- Additive endpoints: `/api/agents/floor`, `/api/agents/{id}/dossier`, `/api/intents/kanban` + `agent_hue()`; existing routes untouched
- Linked from the dashboard topbar; the original 1583-line dashboard is left intact (zero regression risk)

### Schema v7 → v8 (additive)

`skill_uses.quality`; `failure_fingerprints.taxonomy_class/subclass`; `llm_diagnosis_cache.taxonomy_class/subclass`; new `critical_steps`, `ideal_states`, `ideal_state_criteria` tables; forward-compat `shared_log.vote_confidence/decide_mode`. Single-shot migration; fresh-DB and faithful v7→v8 upgrade paths both tested.

### Stats

- **550 unit tests passing** (+85 from 0.8.2; 0 regressions)
- MCP surface **46 → 50 tools**
- 2 new benchmark folders (`demo_quality_score_bench/`, `demo_critical_step_bench/`); every prior benchmark re-run with unchanged numbers
- `record_outcome` hot-path overhead still negligible with the quality column

### Honest limits that remain

- §6.1 ARC-AGI-3 still a simulation (unchanged from 0.8.2)
- Quality variance-reduction was hypothesised, measured, and did not hold — reported, not hidden
- Pure pattern-matching only reaches the system/action taxonomy classes; the higher reasoning classes need the LLM diagnoser or the localizer
- ISA authoring is manual (LLM-generated ISAs explicitly deferred)
- Aegean intentionally unbuilt until real concurrency demand exists

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-24

### Addressing Whitepaper §6 Limitations Using KAOS Itself

v0.8.2 closes the gaps identified in the v0.8.1 whitepaper's Limitations section. Every item is tackled with real code, real tests, and real measured numbers — no shortcuts, no hardcoding.

**Policy consumer loop closed (§6.3a)**
- `SharedLog.intent_auto(agent_id, action)` matches the intent against the `policies` table; enabled + promoted policies auto-approve by appending a synthetic vote + decision and bumping `applied_count` / `last_applied_at`
- Safe on pre-schema-v5 databases (gracefully falls through to standard `intent()`)
- `intent()` itself is unchanged

**Merge workflow loop closed (§6.3b)**
- `list_pending_merges()`, `accept_merge(proposal_id, keep_skill_id=...)`, `reject_merge(proposal_id, reason=...)` in `kaos/dream/phases/consolidation.py`
- Accept migrates `skill_uses` telemetry, collapses associations (weight-merging on conflict, self-edges pruned), rolls counters into the keeper, soft-deprecates the retired skill with a merge rationale
- CLI: `kaos dream merges [--accept N | --reject N --reason "..." | --keep K]`
- MCP: `dream_merges` tool (MCP surface 45 → **46 tools**)

**LLM-backed diagnoser with fingerprint cache (§6.4)**
- `LLMDiagnoser(call_fn, conn, model)` in `kaos/dream/diagnosis.py`
- Cache-first: `llm_diagnosis_cache` keyed by error fingerprint; each unique failure pays the LLM cost at most once
- Heuristic-primary: `diagnose(..., llm_fallback=d)` only calls the LLM when every heuristic returns `None`
- Provider-agnostic: takes a `Callable[[str], str]` — works with any model (Anthropic SDK, raw httpx vLLM, mock)
- Robust JSON parsing handles prose-prefixed, markdown-fenced, and ill-formed responses; graceful degradation when the callback raises

**Three new benchmarks with real measured numbers (§6.1)**
- `demo_realistic_retrieval_bench/` — non-adversarial library (40 realistic engineering skills, natural-language queries, deployment-specific ground truth). **BM25 73.3% → weighted 86.7% (+13.3 pp, +18.2%)**
- `demo_alpha_sweep_bench/` — sensitivity sweep over the plasticity weight `usage_multiplier ∈ {0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12}`. Default α=3.0 sits on a **broad plateau at 93.3% covering α = 2–12** — not a knife-edge choice
- `demo_consolidation_scale_bench/` — wall-clock cost at 100 / 1k / 10k skills: **108 ms / 493 ms / 38.1 s**. Sub-linear below 1k; near-quadratic above (Jaccard merge scan). Documented trade-off with mitigation (shard by tag or disable merge detection at very-large scale)

**Schema v6 → v7 (additive)**
- `consolidation_proposals.status` column (`pending` / `applied` / `rejected` / `superseded`) with index; existing `applied=1` rows backfill to `'applied'`
- New `llm_diagnosis_cache` table (fingerprint-keyed, with model attribution)

### Tests

**465 unit tests passing** (+42 from 0.8.1; 0 regressions)
- `tests/test_policy_consumer.py` — 7 tests
- `tests/test_merge_workflow.py` — 18 tests
- `tests/test_llm_diagnoser.py` — 17 tests

### Honest limits that remain

- §6.1 is *partially* resolved: three new realistic benchmarks land with real numbers, but the ARC-AGI-3 scenario is still a simulation of a live meta-harness run, not a live execution
- §6.2 (biological metaphor) and §6.5 (platform dependence of absolute timings) are **unchanged** — the explicit "architectural analogy, not neurobiological claim" disclaimer and the policy of reporting *deltas* rather than raw latencies are the honest framing, not gaps to close

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-24

### Neuroplasticity: The Library Rewires Itself

KAOS v0.8.1 turns the agent library from a passive filing cabinet into a
self-organizing graph. Inline synaptic plasticity plus batched structural
consolidation.

**Inline plasticity hooks (synaptic)**
- `SkillStore.record_outcome()`, `MemoryStore.search(record_hits=True)`, and `Kaos.complete/fail/kill()` write telemetry in the caller's existing transaction — zero extra fsync
- Opt-out: `KAOS_DREAM_AUTO=0`

**Batched structural consolidation (sleep)**
- Agent completion rebuilds the Hebbian graph for the session via one `executemany`
- Every `KAOS_DREAM_THRESHOLD` (default 100) completions, full consolidation proposes promote/prune/merge
- All proposals journalled; safe actions auto-applied, merges stay human-review

**Weighted retrieval**
- New `rank="weighted"` on skill + memory search: BM25 × Wilson-lower-bound success × recency decay
- CLI: `kaos skills search --rank weighted`, `kaos memory search --rank weighted`
- Default remains BM25; weighted is opt-in per call

**Failure intelligence**
- 8 built-in heuristic diagnosers categorise errors (transient/config/code/infra/unknown) with root cause + suggested action
- Fix-outcome tracking auto-downgrades broken "known fixes" after 5+ failed attempts
- Systemic alerts fire when ≥N agents hit the same fingerprint inside a sliding window

**Schema v6 (additive)**
- New tables: `skill_uses`, `memory_hits`, `episode_signals`, `dream_runs`, `associations`, `failure_fingerprints`, `failure_occurrences`, `systemic_alerts`, `consolidation_proposals`, `policies`
- New agent_skills columns: `deprecated`, `deprecated_at`, `deprecated_reason`

**CLI: 10 new commands under `kaos dream`**
`run`, `runs`, `show`, `related`, `consolidate`, `failures`, `diagnose`, `fix-outcome`, `systemic`. Plus `--rank` flag on `skills search` and `memory search`.

**MCP: 8 new tools**
`dream_run`, `dream_related`, `dream_consolidate`, `failure_lookup`, `failure_list`, `failure_diagnose`, `failure_fix_outcome`, `systemic_alerts`. Total MCP surface: **45 tools**.

### Measured performance (reproducible benchmarks committed in the repo)

- **Retrieval accuracy**: BM25 80% → weighted 90% (+10 pp) on disambiguation-dominated benchmark (`demo_neuroplasticity_bench/`, seed=42)
- **Hot-path overhead**: +15 µs p50 `record_outcome`, +872 µs p50 `agent_complete` (`demo_plasticity_overhead_bench/`)
- **Failure triage**: 60/60 validations (`demo_failure_intelligence_bench/`)
- **Stats**: 423 unit tests passing (+30 new, 0 regressions); 181 scenario validations total

### Architecture rewrite

Initial design (v0.8.0) fired inline association upserts on every `record_outcome` — committed microbenchmark measured +210 ms p50 overhead and rejected the build pre-merge. Rewrote graph construction to batched-at-completion. **14,000× faster.**

### Documentation

- [Blog post (growth story with charts + demo GIF)](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-neuroplasticity.html)
- [Whitepaper with simulated adversarial review](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/papers/kaos-neuroplasticity-whitepaper.html)
- [docs/neuroplasticity.md](docs/neuroplasticity.md) — full mechanism reference

### Honest limits
- Gains are workload-conditional (requires outcome feedback + retrieval ambiguity)
- `policies` table populates but is not yet consulted (M4 scaffolding)
- Merge detection uses Jaccard-on-word-bags; catches obvious duplicates, misses semantic ones
- Heuristic diagnosers cover common cases; exotic errors stay `unknown`

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-15

### Cross-Agent Skill Library (arXiv:2604.08224 — Zhou et al. 2026)

Adds a dedicated skill library distinct from memory. Skills are *procedural* artifacts — parameterized prompt templates that encode reliable solution strategies. Agents save them; any agent in any future session can search and apply them.

**Core**
- `kaos/skills.py` — `SkillStore` with `save`, `search` (FTS5+BM25), `get`, `list`, `apply`, `record_outcome`, `delete`, `stats`
- Skills have `{param}` placeholders in templates. `skill.params()` returns the list; `skill.apply(**kwargs)` renders the filled prompt.
- `use_count` / `success_count` tracked per skill. `kaos skills ls --order success_count` surfaces what actually works.
- Skills are shared across all agents in the project — any agent can read any other agent's skills.

**Schema v3**
- New `agent_skills` table with FTS5 virtual table (`agent_skills_fts`) and insert/update/delete sync triggers.
- Porter unicode61 stemming over name, description, tags, and template body.
- Migration applied automatically to existing databases.

**MCP tools** (30 total, +5)
- `skill_save` — save a new skill with name, description, template, tags, source agent
- `skill_search` — BM25 full-text search across all skills
- `skill_apply` — render a skill template with parameters; optionally record outcome immediately
- `skill_list` — list skills with tag/agent/sort filters
- `skill_outcome` — record success or failure for reliability tracking

**CLI**
- `kaos skills save --name X --description Y --template Z --tags a,b`
- `kaos skills search "query"` — FTS5+BM25, supports phrases, NOT, wildcards
- `kaos skills ls --order success_count`
- `kaos skills apply <id> -p key=value`
- `kaos skills delete <id>`

**Tests** — 37 new tests (256 total)

**Memory vs Skills distinction**

| | Memory | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| What it stores | Facts, observations, results | Procedures, templates |
| Example | "Accuracy was 87% with ensemble" | "Use {n} models with {voting} voting" |
| Table | `memory` | `agent_skills` |

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### CORAL: Autonomous Multi-Agent Evolution (inspired by arXiv:2604.01658)

Three tiers of CORAL-inspired improvements to the Meta-Harness.

**Tier 1 — Stagnation Detection + Pivot Prompts**
- `SearchConfig.stagnation_threshold` (default 3): after N consecutive non-improving iterations, inject a `PIVOT REQUIRED` section into the proposer digest requiring a structurally different approach
- `SearchConfig.consolidation_interval` (default 5): skills heartbeat fires every K iterations
- `stagnant_iterations` and `delta` returned in `mh_next_iteration` response so Claude Code can observe the stagnation signal
- Both automated (`search.py`) and collaborative (`mh_next_iteration`) paths track stagnation

**Tier 2 — Three-Tier Memory (attempts / notes / skills)**
- Search archive gains `/attempts/`, `/notes/`, `/skills/` directories (CORAL filesystem model)
- Every evaluated harness writes a compact summary to `/attempts/{id}.json` — fast scanning without reading full source
- `mh_submit_candidate` accepts optional `notes` param — observations written to `/notes/iter_N.md`
- New MCP tool `mh_write_skill(search_agent_id, name, description, code_template)` — write reusable patterns discovered during search; persisted to knowledge agent across searches
- Skills loaded into every proposer prompt and `mh_next_iteration` digest (max 10, MRU)
- Consolidation heartbeat in digest asks proposer to extract skills every `consolidation_interval` iterations
- Skills survive across searches: `_file_to_knowledge` now archives `/skills/` alongside harnesses

**Tier 3 — Concurrent Multi-Agent Co-Evolution**
- New MCP tool `mh_spawn_coevolution(benchmark, n_agents, ...)` — spawns N independent search agents + 1 hub agent
- New MCP tool `mh_hub_sync(search_agent_id)` — push current best harnesses+skills to hub, pull other agents' discoveries into local archive
- Auto-sync: `mh_next_iteration` calls `_do_hub_sync` automatically every `hub_sync_interval` iterations (default 2)
- Hub structure: `/best_per_agent/agent_N/`, `/shared_skills/`, `/shared_attempts/`
- Cross-agent harnesses appear in next digest and Pareto frontier

### Demo Use Cases

Six end-to-end demonstrations published alongside v0.6.0:

- **[SDLC Self-Healing](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-sdlc-self-healing.html)** — Payment service wrong-fix detected, checkpoint restore in 0.3s, root cause from audit trail, correct fix applied without human intervention
- **[Security Audit Swarm](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-security-swarm.html)** — 4 parallel isolated agents audit a PR (SQLi, secrets, auth, deserialization); findings aggregated via SQL query across VFS
- **[DB Migration Rollback](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-migration-rollback.html)** — 2M-row backfill hits anomaly at row 847,412; surgical per-agent restore in 0.3s; analytics agents untouched
- **[Incident Response](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-incident-response.html)** — 23% HTTP 500 rate; event journal query finds 847 ConnectionPoolErrors; root cause traced to config change 47 min prior; post-mortem auto-written
- **[ML Research Lab](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-ml-research-lab.html)** — 4 parallel hypothesis agents (LoRA, Lion, batch scaling, dropout); winner val_loss=1.89 (-19.2% vs baseline); inspired by Karpathy autoresearch
- **[Regression Guard](https://canivel.github.io/kaos/blog/kaos-regression-guard.html)** — Model swap drops code_review 0.83→0.76; CI gate blocks deploy; 5-iteration Meta-Harness repair restores 0.83 automatically

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-07

### ARC-AGI-3 Benchmark + Search Hang Fix

- **ARC-AGI-3 benchmark** (`kaos/metaharness/benchmarks/arc_agi3.py`) — new interactive game benchmark. Scoring via RHAE (Relative Human Action Efficiency). Harnesses define `run(problem)` + `choose_action(grid, available_actions, state)`. 4 seed strategies: random, systematic, productive-first, click-objects.
- **Fix: search hanging** — root cause: `asyncio.wait_for` cannot cancel `run_in_executor` threads. With old defaults (10 games × 120s × 4 seeds = 80 min) the process appeared frozen. Fixed: `time_per_game=25s`, `max_actions=800`, `n_search_games=6`. Seed eval now takes ~1.5 min (eval_subset=1) or ~3 min (eval_subset=2).
- **MCP stdio guard** — `arc_agi.Arcade()` adds a `logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)` on init, which corrupts the MCP transport. Monkeypatches `StreamHandler.__init__` to redirect any stdout handler to stderr before import.
- **`SearchConfig.harness_timeout_seconds` 300 → 60** — per-problem cap; arc-agi-3 games run at most 25s, all other benchmarks complete in seconds.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-07

### AAAK Compact Notation + Tiered Loading (inspired by MemPalace)

- **AAAK-style compact notation** -- replaces verbose markdown with dense shorthand: `H:keyword|i2|acc=1.0|cost=8.0|8/8✓`. All LLMs read it without decoders. 57% savings at default level (was 34%).
- **Tiered loading** -- L0 (verbose), L1 (AAAK+source), L2 (AAAK+top-3 source), L3 (ultra-compact scores only). Maps to compaction levels 0-10.
- **100% quality at default** across all 5 domains (classification, code gen, research, tool calling, ML) with 49-72% savings per domain.
- **L3 ultra** achieves 95% savings for severely context-limited scenarios.

### Comparison: Old vs AAAK

```
Before (structured extraction):  34% saved, 100% quality at default
After  (AAAK + tiered loading):  57% saved, 100% quality at default  ← +68% more savings
```

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-07

### Surrogate Verifier (EvoSkills paper, arXiv:2604.01687)

- **#31 Surrogate Verifier** -- After evaluating a harness, a separate verifier analyzes the results and produces structured failure diagnostics: per-problem root-cause analysis, failure pattern grouping, and actionable revision suggestions.
- Informationally isolated: verifier reads outputs, NOT harness source code (prevents confirmation bias).
- Integrated into evaluator: every `EvaluationResult` now carries a `diagnosis` with failure patterns, root causes, and suggestions.
- Integrated into compactor: digest includes verifier suggestions and root causes alongside scores/traces.
- Integrated into `mh_next_iteration`: response includes verifier diagnosis text so the proposer (Claude Code) sees structured "why it failed" + "how to fix it" alongside the archive digest.
- MCP stdio fix: `sys.stdout = sys.stderr` was eating MCP protocol responses. Now preserves original stdout for the MCP transport.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Collaborative Meta-Harness — Claude Code IS the proposer

Three new MCP tools that let Claude Code drive the search loop directly. No subprocess, no API key, no extra cost — inference happens in your current session.

- **`mh_start_search`** — evaluates seeds, returns archive digest. YOU read it and write a better harness.
- **`mh_submit_candidate`** — submit your harness code for evaluation.
- **`mh_next_iteration`** — evaluates pending candidates, updates frontier, returns updated digest.

The loop: `mh_start_search` → read digest → write harness → `mh_submit_candidate` → `mh_next_iteration` → read updated digest → repeat.

Why this works: the CLI subprocess bottleneck (354s for 60K chars) is eliminated entirely. Claude Code already has an active API connection — no subprocess, no process startup, no stdin/stdout serialization. The digest goes into the conversation context and the response comes back as part of the normal tool flow.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-06

### New Provider: Claude Agent SDK

- **`provider: agent_sdk`** -- 5th provider type. Uses `claude_agent_sdk.query()` instead of `claude --print` subprocess. No rate limit competition with active Claude Code sessions. Seeds scored 90.6% accuracy vs 0% with `claude_code` provider in the same session.
- **Single-shot proposer** -- proposer makes one LLM call instead of 5-10 multi-turn tool calls. Completes in ~18s vs timing out at 120s+.
- **Empty response = error** -- `claude --print` returning empty stdout now retries 3x with backoff then raises with actionable message instead of silently producing garbage.
- Default timeout 600s → 300s across all providers (120s was too short for complex benchmarks).
- `max_prior_seeds=5` — caps knowledge compounding to top 5 discoveries instead of loading all.

### Provider Comparison

- `agent_sdk` -- shares session auth, no subprocess, works during active sessions
- `claude_code` -- `claude --print` subprocess, only works when session is idle
- `anthropic` -- direct API via httpx, needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, independent quota
- `openai` -- any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, needs API key
- `local` -- vLLM/ollama/llama.cpp, zero cost, needs GPU

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-06

### Bug Fixes

- **#27 Proposer text extraction fallback** -- `claude --print` doesn't support tool-use, so the proposer couldn't call `mh_submit_harness`. Now extracts ```python blocks from plain text responses as a fallback. Works with any provider.

### Compaction Eval

- Expanded to 5 domains: classification (52% saved), code generation (31%), research/RAG (28%), tool calling (30%), ML training (28%)
- 100% quality retained at default level across all domains
- Aggregate: 34% savings at default, 88% quality at max

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Knowledge Compounding (Karpathy LLM Wiki pattern)

- **#22 Cross-search memory** -- Persistent "kaos-knowledge" agent stores winning harnesses and frontiers. New searches automatically load prior discoveries as seeds instead of starting from scratch. Knowledge compounds across searches.
- **#23 VFS auto-index** -- `kaos index <agent-id>` builds `/index.md` with categorized file listing. `Kaos.build_index()` API.
- **#24 Lint operation** -- `kaos mh lint <search-agent-id>` health-checks for empty scores, failed harnesses, iteration errors, missing frontiers.
- **#26 Persistent skills** -- Winning harnesses auto-filed to knowledge agent. `kaos mh knowledge` shows discoveries by benchmark. Future searches use prior winners as seeds.

### Smart Context Compaction (#11 partial fix)

- **Compactor class** -- Tunable compaction (level 0-10) with three strategies: lossless (scores, source), structured extraction (traces → error patterns + samples), progressive summarization (conversation → sliding window).
- **Archive digest** -- Proposer gets a pre-built digest of all harnesses instead of doing 5-10 tool calls. Reduces proposer turns from ~10 to 1-2, fixing the main cause of `claude --print` timeouts.
- **Conversation compaction** -- CCR auto-compacts conversations >20 messages. Old tool results compressed to `[tool result: N chars]`. Recent messages kept verbatim.
- **compaction_level config** -- `SearchConfig.compaction_level` (0-10), configurable in `kaos.yaml`. Level 0 = raw data, 5 = balanced (default), 10 = maximum.
- **38 compaction tests** -- Monotonic compression verified across all levels. Retention score measured (scores + source always preserved). Digest quality validated at 7 levels.

### Full-Text Search (Hermes Agent pattern)

- **#25 VFS search** -- `kaos search "query"` searches across all file contents. `--agent` scopes to one agent. `Kaos.search()` API. Returns agent_id, path, line number, matching content.

### New CLI Commands

- `kaos search <query>` -- full-text search across all agent VFS contents
- `kaos index <agent-id>` -- build /index.md for an agent's VFS
- `kaos mh lint <search-id>` -- health-check a search archive
- `kaos mh knowledge` -- view persistent knowledge base / discoveries

### New Core API

- `Kaos.get_or_create_singleton(name)` -- get or create a persistent named agent
- `Kaos.build_index(agent_id)` -- build /index.md for an agent
- `Kaos.search(query, agent_id=None)` -- full-text search across file contents

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes

- **#1 CLI Unicode crash on Windows** -- `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8")` at CLI startup prevents `UnicodeEncodeError` with cp1252 console encoding.
- **#2 MCP parallel spawn WAL contention** -- `spawn()` retries up to 3 times on `OperationalError: database locked` with backoff. `PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint=100` keeps WAL file small.
- **#7 MCP result truncation for large outputs** -- Results >4KB are written to agent VFS at `/result.txt`. MCP returns a preview + pointer to full result via `agent_read`.
- **#16 Background search write lock** -- `wal_autocheckpoint=100` ensures frequent WAL checkpointing, reducing lock hold time for concurrent access.

### New CLI Commands

- **`kaos read <agent_id> <path>`** (#4) -- Read files from an agent's virtual filesystem directly from the CLI. Supports `--json`.
- **`kaos logs <agent_id>`** (#6) -- View an agent's conversation history and event log. `--tail N` for last N events. Supports `--json`.

### Other

- **#3 Agent timeout** -- Already fixed in v0.3.0 (600s default, configurable via `kaos.yaml`). Closed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### CLI-First Architecture

- **`--json` flag on all CLI commands** -- Global `--json` flag (auto-enabled when piped) adds structured JSON output to every command: `ls`, `status`, `query`, `kill`, `checkpoint`, `checkpoints`, `mh search`, `mh frontier`, `mh status`. Errors output as `{"error": "..."}`. Makes KAOS composable with any agent framework via shell -- no MCP required.

- **Worker subprocess for `mh search`** -- New `kaos/metaharness/worker.py` runs the Meta-Harness search as a detached background process. If the parent CLI or MCP server dies, the search continues. Launch with `kaos mh search --background` or via the MCP `mh_search` tool (which now always spawns a worker).

- **`provider: claude_code`** -- New provider type that shells out to `claude --print` using Claude Code's subscription auth. No API key needed. Handles Windows `.CMD` wrapper parsing, `CLAUDECODE` env var stripping, nvm path resolution, and thread-executor subprocess for MCP compatibility.

### Reliability Fixes

- **Fail-fast retries** -- `max_retries` default changed from 3 to 1. With `ClaudeCodeProvider`, each retry is a 600s subprocess -- retries are now handled at the search loop level, not the provider level.

- **Proposer timeout + error handling** -- `proposer.propose()` wrapped with `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=900s)` and try/except. Failed iterations are logged to `/iterations/{N}/error.json` and skipped instead of crashing the search.

- **SQLite DB locking fix** -- `busy_timeout` raised from 5s to 30s. `kill()` falls back to `_force_kill()` with a fresh connection on `OperationalError: database is locked`. Prevents stuck agents when multiple processes share `kaos.db`.

- **Evaluator bug fixes** -- `_truncate()` no longer creates invalid JSON on large results. Error/timeout score keys stripped of `+`/`-` prefixes to match success score keys.

- **Usage field mismatch fix** -- `GEPARouter._parse_response()` handles both `VLLMClient` (`prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`) and `LLMProvider` (`input_tokens`/`output_tokens`) field names.

### Configuration

- **`ModelConfig.timeout`** -- Per-model timeout (default 600s), configurable in `kaos.yaml` and wired through `GEPARouter` to `ClaudeCodeProvider`.
- **`SearchConfig.proposer_timeout_seconds`** -- Per-iteration proposer timeout (default 900s).
- **MCP `mh_frontier` enriched** -- Now returns agent status, current iteration, and harnesses evaluated count alongside the frontier data.

### Upgrade Guide

```bash
git pull origin main
uv sync
kaos --version  # should show 0.3.1
```

If you have the MCP server running, restart it so it picks up the new code. Claude Code restarts the MCP server automatically when you start a new session. Any running background workers will continue on the old version until they finish.

If upgrading from v0.1.0/v0.2.0:
- Existing `kaos.yaml` configs and `kaos.db` databases work unchanged across versions.
- New `provider: claude_code` option available -- run `kaos setup` to reconfigure.
- CLI commands now output JSON when piped. Use `--json` flag explicitly in scripts.
- `kaos mh search --background` is the recommended way to run searches.
- New commands: `kaos read`, `kaos logs`, `kaos mh search --dry-run`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-02

### Meta-Harness & Multi-Provider

- Paper-aligned Meta-Harness implementation (arXiv:2603.28052)
- Multi-provider support: `local`, `openai`, `anthropic` (all raw httpx)
- `kaos setup` interactive wizard with 6 presets
- 18 MCP tools (added `agent_pause`, `agent_resume`, `agent_checkpoints`, `mh_search`, `mh_frontier`, `mh_resume`)
- Resume interrupted Meta-Harness searches
- Dashboard Meta-Harness panel
- Paper benchmark loaders (LawBench, Symptom2Disease, USPTO-50k)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-30
